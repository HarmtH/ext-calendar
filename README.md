Getting started
===============

Add the package as a dependency in your `composer.json` file:

    require {
        "fisharebest/localization": "1.*"
    }

Bootstrap the package before you use it:

    // bootstrap.php
    \Fisharebest\ExtCalendar\Bootstrap\init();

Development
===========

Note that `require-dev` will require `ext-calendar`, as we use it as a reference
implementation for testing.

Pull requests are welcome.  Please ensure you include unit-tests where applicable,
and follow the coding conventions.  These are to follow PSR, except for

* tabs are used for indentation
* opening braces always go on the end of the previous line
